# Wellcome to The CMS API Project

This project is a Content Management System (CMS) API developed using Node.js, Typescript, Express.js, and MongoDB. The API is designed to handle content creation, management. It offers a variety of features for both administrators and content editors, including user authentication, media uploads, and content filtering.

- **important**: Please attention this project is **not yet ready for production** but you can uses this api for any front-end framework such as react, vue, angular. so, clone project and create own container based on front-end framework and all api ready for you ðŸ˜‰

## Features

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization

- Implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Implements user authorization for user can access own articles.
- Role-based access control is integrated, allowing different user permissions (admin, user). for example just user admin can create categories

### 2. Content Creation & Management

- The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for content such as:
  - Articles
  - Categories
  - Users
- Efficient handling of content relationships (e.g., posts associated with categories and user).

### 3. Media Upload & Management

- Allows upload, validation image file and management of media files.

### 4. RESTful API Design

- Follows RESTful architecture principles, making it easy to integrate with any front-end client or third-party services.
- Supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for handling requests.

### 5. MongoDB Integration

- The API uses MongoDB as the database for storing content, user data, and metadata.
- Utilizes Mongoose to define schemas, enforce validation, and interact with the database.

### 6. Data Validation

- The API uses Zod for full validation all incoming data from client

### 7. Search & Filtering & Pagination

- The API provides advanced search and filtering capabilities:
  - Search by keyword, title.
  - Filter by categories, publication date, createdAt, updatedAt.
  - Paginated results for large datasets.

### 8. API Documentation

- Comprehensive API documentation is provided using tools such as Swagger or Postman.
- Includes clear guidelines for usage, endpoint descriptions, and sample requests/responses.

**Note**: For a full list of available endpoints details and their usage, please run project with docker and go to http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

## Installation

- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have installed docker and Docker-compose on your local machine
- **Default user admin for development**:
    - Email: admin@gmail.com
    - Password: admin1234
- for first time run application user admin is created but if you can disable user admin, just go to `server.ts` file and comment `await createUserAdmin();`
- if you can connect to mongodb with compass just use this uri:
    - `mongodb://localhost:3001`

## Steps

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammadBohluli/cms-blog-backend.git

cd cms-blog-backend
```

- Run project

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- after above command project available :

  - local address: http://localhost:3000/api
  - document: http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

- if you need show logs and see request realtime

```bash
docker logs -f nodejs
```

- if you need shutdown all containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Coming Soon
